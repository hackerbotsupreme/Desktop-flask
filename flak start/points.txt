Flask – (Creating first simple application)


Building a webpage using python.

There are many modules or frameworks which allow building your webpage using python like a bottle, Django, Flask, etc. But the real popular ones are Flask and Django. Django is easy to use as compared to Flask but Flask provides you with the versatility to program with.
To understand what Flask is you have to understand a few general terms. 

    WSGI Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) has been adopted as a standard for Python web application development. WSGI is a specification for a universal interface between the web server and the web applications. 
    Werkzeug It is a WSGI toolkit, which implements requests, response objects, and other utility functions. This enables building a web framework on top of it. The Flask framework uses Werkzeug as one of its bases.
    jinja2 jinja2 is a popular templating engine for Python. A web templating system combines a template with a certain data source to render dynamic web pages. 

Flask is a web application framework written in Python. Flask is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. Both are Pocco projects.

Installation:

We will require two packages to set up your environment. virtualenv for a user to create multiple Python environments side-by-side. Thereby, it can avoid compatibility issues between the different versions of the libraries and the next will be Flask itself. 

virtualenv 

pip install virtualenv

Create Python virtual environment

virtualenv venv

Activate virtual environment

windows > venv\Scripts\activate
linux > source ./venv/bin/activate

For windows, if this is your first time running the script, you might get an error like below:

venv\Scripts\activate : File C:\flask_project\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For  
more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
At line:1 char:1
+ venv\Scripts\activate
   + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess

This means that you don’t have access to execute the scripts.

To solve this error, run the powershell as admin, when you right click on powershell icon, choose the option ‘Run as adminstrator’. Now, the powershell will open in the admin mode.

Type the following command in Shell

    set-executionpolicy remotesigned

Now, you will be prompted to change the execution policy. Please type A. This means Yes to all.

Flask 

pip install Flask

After completing the installation of the package, let’s get our hands on the code.
Python3
# Importing flask module in the project is mandatory
# An object of Flask class is our WSGI application.
from flask import Flask
 
# Flask constructor takes the name of
# current module (__name__) as argument.
app = Flask(__name__)
 
# The route() function of the Flask class is a decorator,
# which tells the application which URL should call
# the associated function.
@app.route('/')
# ‘/’ URL is bound with hello_world() function.
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World'
 
# main driver function
if __name__ == '__main__':
 
    # run() method of Flask class runs the application
    # on the local development server.
    app.run()
